### App Description
> This app allows user to choose a session duration and a break duration using the up/down arrow buttons in the boxes that say 'Break-length' and 'Session-length' and then user can start the countdown timer using the play/pause button. Once timer is started, it counts down the session duration and then the break duration. User may stop the timer at any time using the play/pause button. Also, there is a reset button that user can click to stop the timer and reset all values to their defaults.

### Implementation Note
This implementation uses the javascript setTimeout() method.

### Note about icons used in the HTML file
> I've used Fontawesome icons for the up/down arrows in the buttons. These icons are placed within 'i' tags in the HTML file. In order to use Fontawesome icons, one has to download a kit from Fontawesome.com. A kit is basically a script tag supplied by Fontawesome.com which one needs to include in the head section of the HTML. Since my kit is my own, I have **NOT** included it in head section of the HTML file that I have uploaded to this repo. So, if you'd like to use up/down arrow icons that I **do** include in the HTML, please make sure that you **get your own Fontawesome kit and include it in the head section of the HTML.** Alternatively, *you may use icons from any other source online and in that case please make sure you update the HTML file as needed to use your own icons.*
